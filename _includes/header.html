            <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Walton Lee and I am currently completing
            a five-year combined MS/BS program in computer science at Tufts University.
            My interests include big data, computer graphics and web development. I'm also a huge
            fan of Ultimate Frisbee, Settlers of Catan and games in general.</p>
